<h3>About Friend Finder</h3>
<p>During these times, it can be hard to connect with fellow classmates. We completely understand that.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that when group studying is done correctly, it can have SEVERAL advantages vs. studying alone.</p>
<p>A study done by a behavioral scientist showed that studying in groups actually increases the chance of processing difficult conceptual topics.</p>
<p>Don't be scared to reach out to fellow classmates, but keep ALL academic integrity information in mind.</p>

    <h1>Find Friends in CS312</h1>

<br>
<h3>About Friend Finder</h3>
<p>During these times, it can be hard to connect with fellow classmates. We completely understand that.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that when group studying is done correctly, it can have SEVERAL advantages vs. studying alone.</p>
<p>A study done by a behavioral scientist showed that studying in groups actually increases the chance of processing difficult conceptual topics.</p>
<p>Don't be scared to reach out to fellow classmates, but keep ALL academic integrity information in mind.</p>
<p>You can access the academic integrity in UTCS presentation here: <a href = "https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/misc/Academic_Integrity.pdf" >https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/misc/Academic_Integrity.pdf</a></p>
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press the new social profile button to create a profile in our database.</li>
<li>Look around in the list and pick a few people to reach out to!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rules and Notices</h3>
<li>Please note that for security reasons, we do not allow the editing or removal of a profile.</li>
<li>Please refrain from creating multiple profiles or trolling.</li>
<li>Please provide accurate information so that classmates can reach out without hassle.</li>
