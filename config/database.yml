# Postgres Database - Manually Altered and Updated by Omeed Tehrani.
#   Use the PG Gem to avoid issues in production deployment.

#   Ensure the pg gem is defined in your file. 
#   The GEMFILE SHOULD CONTAIN THIS LINE => gem 'pg'
#   Contact omeed@cs.utexas.edu for further instructions on how databases work if you are confused.
#   Heroku deployment is preferred for this learning hub.
